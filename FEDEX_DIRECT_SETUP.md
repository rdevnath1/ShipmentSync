## üîÑ Integration with Existing Workflow

The FedEx direct integration works alongside your existing setup:

1. **Rate Shopping**: FedEx rates can be included in rate comparisons
2. **Order Processing**: Create FedEx labels directly from orders
3. **ShipStation Updates**: FedEx tracking numbers are automatically synced
4. **Audit Logging**: All FedEx operations are logged for compliance

## üö® Important Notes

### Sandbox vs Production
- **Always test with Sandbox first**: `https://apis-sandbox.fedex.com`
- **Switch to Production** when ready: `https://apis.fedex.com`
- **Sandbox tracking numbers** won't work with real FedEx tracking

### Rate Accuracy
- Direct FedEx rates reflect your actual account pricing
- Include negotiated discounts and volume pricing
- More accurate than generic rate calculators

### Label Requirements
- **From Address**: Must be associated with your FedEx account
- **Packaging**: Use appropriate packaging type for service
- **Weight/Dimensions**: Must be accurate for proper rating

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"FedEx API credentials not configured"**
- Verify credentials are saved in Settings
- Check that all required fields are filled
- Ensure API URL is correct (sandbox vs production)

**"Authentication failed"**
- Double-check Client ID and Client Secret
- Verify credentials haven't expired
- Check FedEx Developer Portal for account status

**"Invalid account number"**
- Ensure 9-digit account number is correct
- Verify account is active and in good standing
- Check that account supports API access

**"Label creation failed"**
- Verify from address is valid for your account
- Check package weight and dimensions
- Ensure destination address is complete

### Support

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check the test script output** for detailed error messages
2. **Review server logs** for FedEx API responses
3. **Verify credentials** in FedEx Developer Portal
4. **Contact support** with specific error messages

## üéØ Next Steps
