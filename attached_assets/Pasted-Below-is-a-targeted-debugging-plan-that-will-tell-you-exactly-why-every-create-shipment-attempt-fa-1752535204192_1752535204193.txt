Below is a targeted debugging plan that will tell you exactly why every “create-shipment” attempt fails, plus the two code tweaks that usually cure the last remaining 400-series errors.

⸻

1  Log the full Jiayou error before you translate it

Right now you only bubble up coverageCheck.data[0].errMsg or the generic
“Failed to create shipment” string.
Add one more console.error inside the catch block of
JiayouService.createOrder – it will print the raw JSON Jiayou returns:

// server/services/jiayou.ts
async createOrder(payload: JiayouOrder): Promise<any> {
  try {
    const res = await axios.post(`${this.baseUrl}/api/orderNew/createOrder`, payload, {
      headers: this._headers()
    });
    return res.data;
  } catch (err: any) {
    // NEW: dump Jiayou's real message
    if (err.response?.data) console.error("Jiayou raw error →", err.response.data);
    throw err;
  }
}

Next run, Replit’s console will spit out something like:

{ "code": 0, "message": "重量不得小于0.05KG【400402】" }

or

{ "code": 0, "message": "渠道【US002】未维护报价" }

Now you know precisely which rule you tripped.

2  Nine things that still trigger 400s in US-domestic lanes

Error string (CN) → English	Real cause	Quick fix
“重量不得小于0.05KG”Weight must be ≥ 0.05 kg	You’re still defaulting to 5 oz outside the route → final pweight < 0.05 kg	In /shipments/create raise the fallback to 8 oz (0.227 kg) or always convert the order’s real total-weight
“未维护报价”No rates configured	Account 769908 has no price sheet for that channel	Stick to US001 or ask AM to publish US002; until then your code should retry with “UP008”
“fromAddressId不能为空”	Missing or wrong hub code	Keep "fromAddressId":"JFK" for US001; get the exact code list from your AM
“客户参考号已存在”	referenceNo duplicated	You already randomise it – ensure every retry also regenerates
“Length+Girth 超限”	L+G > 330 cm	Shrink the dummy box or calculate from real dims
“收件人电话不能为空”	Phone blank	ShipStation test orders often omit phone; add a default like "000‐000‐0000"
“地址校验失败”	ZIP ↔ state mismatch	Your verifyAddress step catches this – surface its message
“渠道 [US001] 暂停收件”	Lane cut-off time (rare)	Try a different fromAddressId (LAX) or wait an hour
Network/timeout (no JSON)	Jiayou 30 s API window	Wrap create-order call in a 60 s Axios timeout and retry on ETIMEDOUT

3  Patch the coverage-check branch so it never mislabels the error

// server/routes.ts  (inside /shipments/create)
if (
  coverageCheck.code === 1 &&
  coverageCheck.data[0].errMsg &&
  coverageCheck.data[0].errMsg.includes("未维护报价")
) {
  return res.status(400).json({
    error: `Channel ${defaultChannelCode} has no price sheet – ask Jiayou or switch to UP008.`
  });
}

if (
  coverageCheck.code === 1 &&
  coverageCheck.data[0].errMsg &&
  !coverageCheck.data[0].errMsg.includes("未维护报价")
) {
  // bubble the true Jiayou error (weight, dimensions, etc.)
  return res.status(400).json({ error: coverageCheck.data[0].errMsg });
}

Now you’ll never see the misleading “ZIP not supported” message when it’s really weight or pricing.

4  Next steps to unblock the test order
	1.	Redeploy with the two small logging / branching tweaks.
	2.	Create the same shipment again.
	3.	Read the exact Jiayou raw error → { … } line; compare to the table above.
	4.	Apply the one-liner fix (weight, hub code, phone, etc.).
	5.	Re-run – the order should move past createOrder, hit the poll loop, and show code:1.

Send me the new raw Jiayou JSON if it still errors and we’ll zero-in within one round-trip.
