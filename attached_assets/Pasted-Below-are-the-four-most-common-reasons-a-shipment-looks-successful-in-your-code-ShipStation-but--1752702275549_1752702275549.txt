Below are the four most common reasons a shipment looks “successful” in your code / ShipStation but never shows up in Jiayou’s seller portal, plus the exact places to check in the Replit project you just ran.

Where it can break	What to confirm (in Replit console & code)	Typical symptom	Fix
1  createOrder never actually fires	In shipment-dashboard-backend.js the very first line inside jyCreateOrder prints nothing. Put console.log(\"→ calling /createOrder for\", payload.referenceNo); before the axios call. Run /sync again; you should see that line.	Your /sync response shows coverageCheck passed, but console never logs “→ calling /createOrder …”.	A branch above (weight/PO-box/price-sheet) is still returning 400 and exiting early. Surface coverageCheck.data[0].errMsg so you see the real Jiayou reason instead of “coverage fail.”
2  createOrder returns 100001 forever	After each poll you print: console.log(\"Jiayou poll\", attempt, data.message);	Console shows “获取单号中，请稍后重试【100001】” 5× then throws “Jiayou never returned tracking,” but your route catches that and still calls ssMarkShipped.	Abort the flow if jyCreateOrder throws. Don’t call ShipStation until data.code === 1.
3  Wrong environment	In .env make sureJY_BASE=https://api.jygjexp.com/v1 (production). If you use /testapi/, those orders appear only in Jiayou’s sandbox site.	Code says “success,” ShipStation shows tracking beginning with JT123…, but nothing in prod portal.	Switch to the prod base URL or log into Jiayou’s sandbox portal to see them.
4  Different merchant (code) in header	Confirm the headers you send to Jiayou are:code: 769908 & apiKey: d370d0ee7e704117bfca9184bc03f590 every time.	If sign is computed with the wrong code, Jiayou silently creates the order under that other customer.	Hard-code process.env.JY_CODE and JY_APIKEY; log them once per /sync run.

Five-minute diagnostic checklist
	1.	Add a single log before the axios post:

console.log("→ Jiayou createOrder", payload.referenceNo, payload.channelCode);


	2.	Watch the console while you hit /sync.
	•	Nothing printed? You never reached createOrder → look at the coverage / weight guard.
	•	Printed + code 1? Jiayou accepted it → must be in the portal (maybe sandbox).
	•	Printed + code 0 / 100001 loop? Fix the specific message (重量不得小于…, fromAddressId不能为空, etc.).
	3.	Open Jiayou portal → search by the referenceNo you just logged.
	•	Not there? You’re hitting the sandbox or a different merchant ID.

Quick code tweaks to prevent “ghost” shipments

// after createOrder poll loop
if (!data || data.code !== 1) {
  throw new Error(`Jiayou failed: ${data?.message || "unknown"}`);
}

// only mark shipped if Jiayou succeeded
const labelUrl = await jyPrintLabel(data.trackingNo);
await ssMarkShipped(order.orderId, data.trackingNo, labelUrl);

…and surface any error back to the browser so you stop assuming it worked.

TL;DR
	•	Log every createOrder attempt and its response; don’t mask Jiayou’s errMsg.
	•	Abort and don’t call ShipStation if Jiayou never returns code 1.
	•	Verify you are on the production base URL with the 769908 code.
Do those three things and any order that reaches ShipStation will also be visible in the Jiayou backend (or you’ll see the exact API error telling you why not). Ping me the next raw console output if something still vanishes and we’ll nail it.
